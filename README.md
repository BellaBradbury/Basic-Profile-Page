# A BASIC PROFILE PAGE


---APP OVERVIEW---

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This page serves as an example of a basic personal page used to advertise an online profile. A minimized layout, neutral color scheme, and clear yet concise content are used to create a sleek, modern site that is easily navigated and understood by all users. Upon entering the site, the user is given the option to input their name and select a theme. This information is not stored and will only be used to personalize the site, creating a mock-profile page for the user. If the user declines to customize, the default site will display with the developer's information.
