        <h3>THEATER</h3>
        <p>When I'm not hard at work on a web project, I can usually be found pursuing an artistic project where I can sharpen my creative, adaptive, and communicative skills.</p>
        <p>I've enjoyed acting since preschool where I was a part of my school's christmas play, How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Since then I have accrued over two decades of experience and have performed in well over 150 productions. Most recently I have been performing in semi-professional projects both onscreen and onstage and always look forward to what the future holds.</p>
        <!-- TODO: this should have a link to my acting portfolio -->

        <h3>READING</h3>
        <p>I most enjoy relaxing when it involves getting cozy with a hot tea and a great book! My favorite genre has always been historical fiction, though over the years I have also come to enjoy more factual pieces.</p>
        <p>Stories I keep coming back to:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>The Giver Quartet <small>(Lois Lowry)</small></li>
          <li>Little Women <small>(Louisa May Alcott)</small></li>
          <li>The Nancy Drew Series <small>(Carolyn Keene)</small></li>
          <li>The Complete Adventures of the Borrowers <small>(Mary Norton)</small></li>
        </ul>
